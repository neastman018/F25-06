"""
A* algorithm implementation for finding the shortest path in a graph.
Args:
    graph (dict): The graph represented as a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of tuples representing the neighbors and their associated costs.
    start (tuple): The starting node.
    goal (tuple): The goal node.
    heuristic (function): The heuristic function used to estimate the cost from a node to the goal.
Returns:
    list or None: The shortest path from the start node to the goal node as a list of nodes. If no path is found, returns None.
